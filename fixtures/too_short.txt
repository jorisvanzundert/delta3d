TREASURE ISLANDPART ONE--The Old Buccaneer1The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral BenbowSQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen havingasked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, fromthe beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of theisland, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, Itake up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time whenmy father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with thesabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to theinn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow--atall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over theshoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, withblack, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, lividwhite. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himselfas he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang sooften afterwards:          "Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned andbroken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit ofstick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared,called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him,he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and stilllooking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard."This is a handy cove," says he at length; "and a pleasant sittyatedgrog-shop. Much company, mate?"My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity."Well, then," said he, "this is the berth for me. Here you, matey," hecried to the man who trundled the barrow; "bring up alongside and helpup my chest. I'll stay here a bit," he continued. "I'm a plain man; rumand bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watchships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, Isee what you're at--there"; and he threw down three or four gold pieceson the threshold. "You can tell me when I've worked through that," sayshe, looking as fierce as a commander.And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had noneof the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed likea mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. The man who camewith the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before atthe Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along thecoast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described aslonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. Andthat was all we could learn of our guest.He was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove orupon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a cornerof the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong. Mostlyhe would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce andblow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who cameabout our house soon learned to let him be. Every day when he came backfrom his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along theroad. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kindthat made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he wasdesirous to avoid them. When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow(as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) hewould look in at him through the curtained door before he entered theparlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any suchwas present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, forI was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one dayand promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if Iwould only keep my "weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg"and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough when the firstof the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would onlyblow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week wasout he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, andrepeat his orders to look out for "the seafaring man with one leg."How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you. Onstormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house andthe surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in athousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the legwould be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrouskind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in themiddle of his body. To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge andditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear formy monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with oneleg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else whoknew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and waterthan his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing hiswicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would callfor glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to hisstories or bear a chorus to his singing. Often I have heard the houseshaking with "Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum," all the neighbours joiningin for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singinglouder than the other to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the mostoverriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table forsilence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question,or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was notfollowing his story. Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till hehad drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed.His stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful storiesthey were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, andthe Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By hisown account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest menthat God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he toldthese stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as thecrimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would beruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized overand put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe hispresence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on lookingback they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet countrylife, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended toadmire him, calling him a "true sea-dog" and a "real old salt" andsuch like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made Englandterrible at sea.In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying weekafter week, and at last month after month, so that all the money hadbeen long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart toinsist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew throughhis nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poorfather out of the room. I have seen him wringing his hands after such arebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must havegreatly hastened his early and unhappy death.All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in hisdress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of hishat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though itwas a great annoyance when it blew. I remember the appearance of hiscoat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, beforethe end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter,and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for themost part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us hadever seen open.He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poorfather was far gone in a decline that took him off. Dr. Livesey camelate one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from mymother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse shouldcome down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old Benbow. Ifollowed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, brightdoctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes andpleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all,with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting,far gone in rum, with his arms on the table. Suddenly he--the captain,that is--began to pipe up his eternal song:          "Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!           Drink and the devil had done for the rest--             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"At first I had supposed "the dead man's chest" to be that identical bigbox of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingledin my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man. But by thistime we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; itwas new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed itdid not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quiteangrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, ona new cure for the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain graduallybrightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand uponthe table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. The voicesstopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey's; he went on as before speakingclear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word ortwo. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again,glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath,"Silence, there, between decks!""Were you addressing me, sir?" says the doctor; and when the ruffian hadtold him, with another oath, that this was so, "I have only one thing tosay to you, sir," replies the doctor, "that if you keep on drinking rum,the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!"The old fellow's fury was awful. He sprang to his feet, drew and openeda sailor's clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand,threatened to pin the doctor to the wall.The doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him as before, over hisshoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all theroom might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: "If you do not put thatknife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shallhang at the next assizes."Then followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain soonknuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling likea beaten dog."And now, sir," continued the doctor, "since I now know there's such afellow in my district, you may count I'll have an eye upon you day andnight. I'm not a doctor only; I'm a magistrate; and if I catch a breathof complaint against you, if it's only for a piece of incivility liketonight's, I'll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routedout of this. Let that suffice."Soon after, Dr. Livesey's horse came to the door and he rode away, butthe captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come.2Black Dog Appears and DisappearsIT was not very long after this that there occurred the first of themysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as youwill see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hardfrosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poorfather was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and my motherand I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough withoutpaying much regard to our unpleasant guest.It was one January morning, very early--a pinching, frosty morning--thecove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones,the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far toseaward. The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down thebeach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat,his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. Iremember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, andthe last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snortof indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey.Well, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying thebreakfast-table against the captain's return when the parlour dooropened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. Hewas a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, andthough he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. Ihad always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and Iremember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had asmack of the sea about him too.I asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; butas I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a tableand motioned me to draw near. I paused where I was, with my napkin in myhand."Come here, sonny," says he. "Come nearer here."I took a step nearer."Is this here table for my mate Bill?" he asked with a kind of leer.I told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for a person whostayed in our house whom we called the captain."Well," said he, "my mate Bill would be called the captain, as likeas not. He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him,particularly in drink, has my mate Bill. We'll put it, for argumentlike, that your captain has a cut on one cheek--and we'll put it, if youlike, that that cheek's the right one. Ah, well! I told you. Now, is mymate Bill in this here house?"I told him he was out walking."Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?"And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain waslikely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions,"Ah," said he, "this'll be as good as drink to my mate Bill."The expression of his face as he said these words was not at allpleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger wasmistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no affair ofmine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do. Thestranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round thecorner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once I stepped out myself intothe road, but he immediately called me back, and as I did not obey quickenough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face,and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump. As soon as Iwas back again he returned to his former manner, half fawning, halfsneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy and he hadtaken quite a fancy to me. "I have a son of my own," said he, "as likeyou as two blocks, and he's all the pride of my 'art. But the greatthing for boys is discipline, sonny--discipline. Now, if you had sailedalong of Bill, you wouldn't have stood there to be spoke to twice--notyou. That was never Bill's way, nor the way of sich as sailed with him.And here, sure enough, is my mate Bill, with a spy-glass under his arm,bless his old 'art, to be sure. You and me'll just go back into theparlour, sonny, and get behind the door, and we'll give Bill a littlesurprise--bless his 'art, I say again."So saying, the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put mebehind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door. Iwas very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to myfears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself. Hecleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath;and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he feltwhat we used to call a lump in the throat.At last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind him, withoutlooking to the right or left, and marched straight across the room towhere his breakfast awaited him."Bill," said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to makebold and big.The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown hadgone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of aman who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anythingcan be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turnso old and sick."Come, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill, surely," saidthe stranger.The captain made a sort of gasp."Black Dog!" said he."And who else?" returned the other, getting more at his ease. "BlackDog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the AdmiralBenbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, sinceI lost them two talons," holding up his mutilated hand."Now, look here," said the captain; "you've run me down; here I am;well, then, speak up; what is it?""That's you, Bill," returned Black Dog, "you're in the right of it,Billy. I'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I've tooksuch a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk square,like old shipmates."When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either sideof the captain's breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door andsitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as Ithought, on his retreat.He bade me go and leave the door wide open. "None of your keyholes forme, sonny," he said; and I left them together and retired into the bar.For a long time, though I certainly did my best to listen, I could hearnothing but a low gattling; but at last the voices began to grow higher,and I could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain."No, no, no, no; and an end of it!" he cried once. And again, "If itcomes to swinging, swing all, say I."Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths andother noises--the chair and table went over in a lump, a clash of steelfollowed, and then a cry of pain, and the next instant I saw BlackDog in full flight, and the captain hotly pursuing, both with drawncutlasses, and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder. Justat the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendouscut, which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not beenintercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow. You may see thenotch on the lower side of the frame to this day.That blow was the last of the battle. Once out upon the road, BlackDog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful clean pair of heels anddisappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute. The captain, forhis part, stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man. Then hepassed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back intothe house."Jim," says he, "rum"; and as he spoke, he reeled a little, and caughthimself with one hand against the wall."Are you hurt?" cried I."Rum," he repeated. "I must get away from here. Rum! Rum!"I ran to fetch it, but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallenout, and I broke one glass and fouled the tap, and while I was stillgetting in my own way, I heard a loud fall in the parlour, and runningin, beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor. At the sameinstant my mother, alarmed by the cries and fighting, came runningdownstairs to help me. Between us we raised his head. He was breathingvery loud and hard, but his eyes were closed and his face a horriblecolour."Dear, deary me," cried my mother, "what a disgrace upon the house! Andyour poor father sick!"In the meantime, we had no idea what to do to help the captain, nor anyother thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle withthe stranger. I got the rum, to be sure, and tried to put it down histhroat, but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron.It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Liveseycame in, on his visit to my father."Oh, doctor," we cried, "what shall we do? Where is he wounded?""Wounded? A fiddle-stick's end!" said the doctor. "No more wounded thanyou or I. The man has had a stroke, as I warned him. Now, Mrs. Hawkins,just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him, if possible, nothingabout it. For my part, I must do my best to save this fellow's treblyworthless life; Jim, you get me a basin."When I got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up thecaptain's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm. It was tattooedin several places. "Here's luck," "A fair wind," and "Billy Bones hisfancy," were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and upnear the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging fromit--done, as I thought, with great spirit."Prophetic," said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger."And now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look atthe colour of your blood. Jim," he said, "are you afraid of blood?""No, sir," said I."Well, then," said he, "you hold the basin"; and with that he took hislancet and opened a vein.A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyesand looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor withan unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he lookedrelieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raisehimself, crying, "Where's Black Dog?""There is no Black Dog here," said the doctor, "except what you haveon your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke,precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will,dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--""That's not my name," he interrupted."Much I care," returned the doctor. "It's the name of a buccaneer of myacquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what Ihave to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but ifyou take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if youdon't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and goto your own place, like the man in the Bible. Come, now, make an effort.I'll help you to your bed for once."Between us, with much trouble, we managed to hoist him upstairs, andlaid him on his bed, where his head fell back on the pillow as if hewere almost fainting."Now, mind you," said the doctor, "I clear my conscience--the name ofrum for you is death."And with that he went off to see my father, taking me with him by thearm."This is nothing," he said as soon as he had closed the door. "I havedrawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile; he should lie for a weekwhere he is--that is the best thing for him and you; but another strokewould settle him."3The Black SpotABOUT noon I stopped at the captain's door with some cooling drinksand medicines. He was lying very much as we had left him, only a littlehigher, and he seemed both weak and excited."Jim," he said, "you're the only one here that's worth anything, and youknow I've been always good to you. Never a month but I've given you asilver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate, I'm pretty low,and deserted by all; and Jim, you'll bring me one noggin of rum, now,won't you, matey?""The doctor--" I began.But he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice but heartily."Doctors is all swabs," he said; "and that doctor there, why, what dohe know about seafaring men? I been in places hot as pitch, and matesdropping round with Yellow Jack, and the blessed land a-heaving like thesea with earthquakes--what to the doctor know of lands like that?--and Ilived on rum, I tell you. It's been meat and drink, and man and wife,to me; and if I'm not to have my rum now I'm a poor old hulk on a leeshore, my blood'll be on you, Jim, and that doctor swab"; and he ran onagain for a while with curses. "Look, Jim, how my fingers fidges,"he continued in the pleading tone. "I can't keep 'em still, not I. Ihaven't had a drop this blessed day. That doctor's a fool, I tell you.If I don't have a drain o' rum, Jim, I'll have the horrors; I seen someon 'em already. I seen old Flint in the corner there, behind you; asplain as print, I seen him; and if I get the horrors, I'm a man thathas lived rough, and I'll raise Cain. Your doctor hisself said one glasswouldn't hurt me. I'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin, Jim."He was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me for my father,who was very low that day and needed quiet; besides, I was reassured bythe doctor's words, now quoted to me, and rather offended by the offerof a bribe."I want none of your money," said I, "but what you owe my father. I'llget you one glass, and no more."When I brought it to him, he seized it greedily and drank it out."Aye, aye," said he, "that's some better, sure enough. And now, matey,did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?""A week at least," said I."Thunder!" he cried. "A week! I can't do that; they'd have the blackspot on me by then. The lubbers is going about to get the wind of methis blessed moment; lubbers as couldn't keep what they got, and want tonail what is another's. Is that seamanly behaviour, now, I want to know?But I'm a saving soul. I never wasted good money of mine, nor lost itneither; and I'll trick 'em again. I'm not afraid on 'em. I'll shake outanother reef, matey, and daddle 'em again."As he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great difficulty,holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out, andmoving his legs like so much dead weight. His words, spirited as theywere in meaning, contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice inwhich they were uttered. He paused when he had got into a sittingposition on the edge."That doctor's done me," he murmured. "My ears is singing. Lay me back."Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to hisformer place, where he lay for a while silent."Jim," he said at length, "you saw that seafaring man today?""Black Dog?" I asked."Ah! Black Dog," says he. "HE'S a bad un; but there's worse that put himon. Now, if I can't get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mindyou, it's my old sea-chest they're after; you get on a horse--you can,can't you? Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes,I will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe allhands--magistrates and sich--and he'll lay 'em aboard at the AdmiralBenbow--all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em that's left. I wasfirst mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I'm the on'y one as knowsthe place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if Iwas to now, you see. But you won't peach unless they get the black spoton me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man withone leg, Jim--him above all.""But what is the black spot, captain?" I asked."That's a summons, mate. I'll tell you if they get that. But you keepyour weather-eye open, Jim, and I'll share with you equals, upon myhonour."He wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after Ihad given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark,"If ever a seaman wanted drugs, it's me," he fell at last into a heavy,swoon-like sleep, in which I left him. What I should have done had allgone well I do not know. Probably I should have told the whole story tothe doctor, for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent ofhis confessions and make an end of me. But as things fell out, my poorfather died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matterson one side. Our natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, thearranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried onin the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think ofthe captain, far less to be afraid of him.He got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual,though he ate little and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply ofrum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing throughhis nose, and no one dared to cross him. On the night before the funeralhe was as drunk as ever; and it was shocking, in that house of mourning,to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song; but weak as he was,we were all in the fear of death for him, and the doctor was suddenlytaken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house aftermy father's death. I have said the captain was weak, and indeed heseemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength. He clambered upand down stairs, and went from the parlour to the bar and back again,and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on tothe walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a manon a steep mountain. He never particularly addressed me, and it is mybelief he had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper wasmore flighty, and allowing for his bodily weakness, more violent thanever. He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing hiscutlass and laying it bare before him on the table. But with all that,he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and ratherwandering. Once, for instance, to our extreme wonder, he piped up to adifferent air, a kind of country love-song that he must have learned inhis youth before he had begun to follow the sea.So things passed until, the day after the funeral, and about threeo'clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I was standing at the doorfor a moment, full of sad thoughts about my father, when I saw someonedrawing slowly near along the road. He was plainly blind, for he tappedbefore him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes andnose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a hugeold tattered sea-cloak with a hood that made him appear positivelydeformed. I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure.He stopped a little from the inn, and raising his voice in an oddsing-song, addressed the air in front of him, "Will any kind friendinform a poor blind man, who has lost the precious sight of his eyes inthe gracious defence of his native country, England--and God bless KingGeorge!--where or in what part of this country he may now be?""You are at the Admiral Benbow, Black Hill Cove, my good man," said I."I hear a voice," said he, "a young voice. Will you give me your hand,my kind young friend, and lead me in?"I held out my hand, and the horrible, soft-spoken, eyeless creaturegripped it in a moment like a vise. I was so much startled that Istruggled to withdraw, but the blind man pulled me close up to him witha single action of his arm."Now, boy," he said, "take me in to the captain.""Sir," said I, "upon my word I dare not.""Oh," he sneered, "that's it! Take me in straight or I'll break yourarm."And he gave it, as he spoke, a wrench that made me cry out."Sir," said I, "it is for yourself I mean. The captain is not what heused to be. He sits with a drawn cutlass. Another gentleman--""Come, now, march," interrupted he; and I never heard a voice so cruel,and cold, and ugly as that blind man's. It cowed me more than the pain,and I began to obey him at once, walking straight in at the door andtowards the parlour, where our sick old buccaneer was sitting, dazedwith rum. The blind man clung close to me, holding me in one iron fistand leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry. "Lead mestraight up to him, and when I'm in view, cry out, 'Here's a friendfor you, Bill.' If you don't, I'll do this," and with that he gave me atwitch that I thought would have made me faint. Between this and that, Iwas so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror ofthe captain, and as I opened the parlour door, cried out the words hehad ordered in a trembling voice.
